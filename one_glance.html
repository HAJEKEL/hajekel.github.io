                    <p>This literature review evaluates and selects open-source text-to-speech, vision-language, and speech-to-text models to replace proprietary ones used in GazeGPT...</p>
                    <p class="full-summary">The system processes multimodal inputs from a head-mounted eye tracker and a microphone, using gaze data and verbal queries to understand user intent and deliver context-aware responses. Currently dependent on proprietary models like ChatGPT and Elevenlabs, GazeGPT aims to democratize AI by adopting open-source alternatives. The review dissects these models into their fundamental components, offering insights into deep learning history and the evolution from untrainable perceptrons to advanced transformer architectures. It also provides detailed analyses of the best available models for each function, aiming to simplify the complex landscape of modern AI models.</p>
